Schoology Attendance Bookmarklet
===

##SUMMARY

The **Schoology Attendance Bookmarklet** is a simple piece of JavaScript designed to make taking attendance using Schoology's User Analytics page easier.  Students who are to be marked absent are highlighted in <div markdown="0" style="color: white; background-color: red;">bright red</div> according to the following business rules:

* A student is considered absent if he/she has not accessed the course since noon of the previous day
* Determination is independent of the last time the student logged in to Schoology or accessed any other course
